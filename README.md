# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Please note that this project is a work in progress and is not yet completed.

## Overview
This project aims to process and analyze the Titanic dataset to predict survival using various machine learning classifiers and models. The primary objective is to build and evaluate different models to determine their effectiveness in predicting survival and deploy them in a Streamlit application to predict new data.

## Repository Structure
**streamlit_web_app.py**: Contains the code for the Streamlit web application that provides an interface for model predictions.
**model_training.py**: Includes code for training and evaluating various classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a Neural Network.
**xgboost_model_train6.pkl**: Pickled XGBoost model after training.
**xgb.pkl**: Pickled XGBoost model before hyperparameter tuning.
**README.md**: This file.

## Notes
The project is still under development. Features and models may be updated or added.
For any issues or contributions, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
